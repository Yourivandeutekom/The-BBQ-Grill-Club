<h1>Challenge Project: Responsive Club Website</h1>

<h2>The BBQ Grill Club</h2>
<p>CodeCademy gave me the project to build a responsive club website to my liking. They gave me the freedom to choose the club name, page layout and styling and any images i would like to use.</p>

<h2>Project goals</h2>
<p>In this project, you’ll be building your own club group page that will dynamically respond as you adjust the size of your screen!​</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>One of the hardest challenges was to think about what I wanted to build and how I was going to build it. After a lot of thinking I decided to build a club website for my hobby 'Grilling'. The first steps in this project was to open up my Adobe XD and build my prototype. I decided I wanted to go for a new color pallete and new fonts for this project. After I builded my design I started to work on my HTML & CSS file, added the semantics and styled the elements to my liking. I used Grid, FlexBox and Media queries in the process.</p>
